***************************************************************************
THE FILESYSTEM:
***************************************************************************

/ :    The root directory, where everything begins.
/bin : Contains binaries (programs) that must be present for the
	system to boot and run.
/boot: Contains the Linux kernel, initial RAM disk image (for
	drivers needed at boot time), and the boot loader.
	Interesting files:
	/boot/grub/grub.conf or menu.lst, which are used to
	configure the boot loader
 	/boot/vmlinuz, the Linux kerne
/dev: This is a special directory that contains device nodes.
	“Everything is a file” also applies to devices. Here is
	where the kernel maintains a list of all the devices it
	understands.
/etc: The /etc directory contains all of the system-wide
	configuration files. It also contains a collection of shell
	scripts that start each of the system services at boot time.
	Everything in this directory should be readable text.
	Interesting files: While everything in /etc is interesting,
	here are some of my all-time favorites:
 	/etc/crontab, a file that defines when automated jobs
	will run
 	/etc/fstab, a table of storage devices and their
	associated mount points
 	/etc/passwd, a list of the user accounts
/home:In normal configurations, each user is given a directory
	in /home. Ordinary users can write files only in their
	home directories. This limitation protects the system from
	errant user activity.
/lib: Contains shared library files used by the core system
	programs. These are similar to DLLs in Windows.
/lost+found: Each formatted partition or device using a Linux file-
	system, such as ext3, will have this directory. It is used
	in the case of a partial recovery from a filesystem cor-
	ruption event. Unless something really bad has hap-
	pened to your system, this directory will remain empty.
/media: On modern Linux systems the /media directory will
	contain the mount points for removable media such
	as USB drives, CD-ROMs, etc. that are mounted
	automatically at insertion.
/mnt: On older Linux systems, the /mnt directory contains
	mount points for removable devices that have been
	mounted manually.
/opt: The /opt directory is used to install “optional” software.
	This is mainly used to hold commercial software products
	that may be installed on your system.
/proc: The /proc directory is special. It’s not a real filesystem in
	the sense of files stored on your hard drive. Rather, it is
	a virtual filesystem maintained by the Linux kernel. The
	“files” it contains are peepholes into the kernel itself. The
	files are readable and will give you a picture of how the
	kernel sees your computer.
/root: This is the home directory for the root account.
/sbin: This directory contains “system” binaries. These are
	programs that perform vital system tasks that are
	generally reserved for the superuser.
/tmp: The /tmp directory is intended for storage of temporary,
	transient files created by various programs. Some con-
	figurations cause this directory to be emptied each time
	the system is rebooted.
/usr: The /usr directory tree is likely the largest one on a Linux
	system. It contains all the programs and support files
	used by regular users.
/usr/bin: /usr/bin contains the executable programs installed
	by your Linux distribution. It is not uncommon for this
	directory to hold thousands of programs.
/usr/lib: The shared libraries for the programs in /usr/bin.
/usr/local: The /usr/local tree is where programs that are not
	included with your distribution but are intended for
	system-wide use are installed. Programs compiled from
	source code are normally installed in /usr/local/bin.
	On a newly installed Linux system, this tree exists, but it
	will be empty until the system administrator puts some-
	thing in it.
/usr/sbin: Contains more system administration programs.
/usr/share: /usr/share contains all the shared data used by
	programs in /usr/bin. This includes things like default
	configuration files, icons, screen backgrounds, sound
	files, etc.
/usr/share/doc: Most packages installed on the system will include some
	kind of documentation. In /usr/share/doc, we will find
	documentation files organized by package.
/var: With the exception of /tmp and /home, the directories
	we have looked at so far remain relatively static; that is,
	their contents don’t change. The /var directory tree is
	where data that is likely to change is stored. Various
	databases, spool files, user mail, etc. are located here.
/var/log: /var/log contains log files, records of various system
	activity. These are very important and should be mon-
	itored from time to time. The most useful one is /var/
	log/messages. Note that for security reasons on some
	systems, you must be the superuser to view log files.
